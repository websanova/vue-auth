# Vue Auth

Vue.js token based authentication plugin. Supports simple token based and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) authentication.

Note this is the new name for the formerly named `vue-jwt-auth`. Since it's likely this package will expand with potentially more authentication options.

### Tested with

* vue 1.0.26, vue-resource 1.0.2, vue-router 0.7.13
* vue 2.0.1, vue-resource 1.0.2, vue-router 2.0.0

Early support for Vue 2.0 is now available also but may still be a bit unstable due to many changes in the api. Please let me know of any issues you may find.


## Notes

* There is a ton of changes in the `v1.0.0-dev` version, check the change log below.
* Because the changes are quite different a `v1.0.0` version has been started, however it is still very much in dev mode.
* The changes are mostly non breaking but there will be potentially a few (check change log).



## Install

~~~
> sudo npm install @websanova/vue-auth
~~~    

~~~
Vue.use(require('@websanova/vue-auth'), {
    rolesVar: 'type'
});
~~~

**NOTE:** If you do not set your router as `Vue.router = new VueRouter()` then you will need to feed the `router` in directly through the options. Also true for `http`.

~~~
var router = new VueRouter();
Vue.use(Auth, {
    router: router,
    http: http
});
~~~



## Demo

To run the front end part of the demo just install and run. The demo runs on a publicly available server so just the front end needs run.

* Demo server available publicly at https://api-demo.websanova.com
* Demo server on GitHub https://github.com/websanova/laravel-api-demo
* Change the http options root in the `app.js` demo file to a different server for personal testing.

~~~
> sudo npm install
> sudo npm run 1.x.demo
> sudo npm run 2.x.demo
~~~

Note: For Vue 2 demo there is a separate package.json. Unfortunately there is no really great way to run both at the same time.


If a different path is required it must be set in the `demo/app.js` file.

To run the build:

~~~
> sudo webpack
~~~



## User Data

A common gotcha is getting the `$auth.user()` data properly. The plugin is designed to expect the user object to be in the `data` parameter of the response.

Depending on what version of the `vue-resource` plugin you are using the response data itself will come from either `res.json()` or `res.data`. Note that the data here is not the response data.

Sample response.

~~~
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Websanova",
        ...
    }    
}
~~~

The plugin has a function for parsing this user data when it receives it called `_parseUserData`. The `data` variable there is the `res.json()` or `res.data` object.

~~~
function _parseUserData(data) {
    return data.data;
}
~~~

If a different format is needed simply override this function in the options.

~~~
Vue.use(require('vue-auth'), {
    _parseUserData: function (data) {
        return data.whatever;
    }
});
~~~

### User Fetching

By default, user fetch request is happening after every login. This is a useful shortcut, but sometimes we don't need this functionality.

We can pass the `fetchData` option to control this behaviour.

~~~
Vue.use(require('@websanova/vue-auth'), {
  notFoundRedirect: '/',
  rolesVar: 'user_permissions',
  fetchData: null
})
~~~

If you pass a falsy value for `fetchData`, automatic user fetching will not happen.

If you don't pass the `fetchData` option, the plugin will do the user fetching with default parameters.

If you pass a custom object for `fetchData`, the plugin will use that configuration when fetching the user. Make sure that you provide an config object that has `url` and `method` properties in this case.



## Authentication

Because there are so many different authentication schemes with tokens Vue Auth uses a simple model so that it can easily be extended for custom scenarios.

Each request and response that is made to the server is intercepted internally by the plugin.

* The internal request method will fetch the current token (internally) and pass it to the auth `request` driver method where it can be processed for delivery to the server.
* The internal response method will behave in a similar fashion however it should deliver a token to the internal response intercept where that token will get stored.

The current `bearer` driver is quite simple and looks like this:

~~~
bearerAuth: {
    request: function (req, token) {
        this.options._setHeaders.call(this, req, {Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token});
    },
    response: function (res) {
        var token = this.options._getHeaders.call(this, res).Authorization;

        if (token) {
            token = token.split('Bearer ');
            
            return token[token.length > 1 ? 1 : 0];
        }
    }
},
~~~

The driver `request` method receives the `req` and `token` arguments. From there we use an internal `_setHeaders` method. However with the `req` object pretty much anything can be assembled.

The driver `response` method receives the `res` argument and should parse out the token from the response and return a token which will get stored internally by the plugin.

To setup a custom driver we simply need to set the `authType` option and the naming convention will follow.

**Example 1: Token in sub object of body** 

Maybe the token is returned in a non standard way such as `{data: {token: 'abcd1234'}}`.

~~~
authType: 'custom1',

custom1Auth: {
    request: function (req, token) {
        req.headers.set('SomeHeader', token);
    },
    response: function (res) {
        return (res.data.data || {}).token;
    }
}
~~~

**Example 2: Token with multiple parts** 

Another common scenario may be a token with multiple data points that all need to be returned to the server.

~~~
authType: 'custom2',

custom2Auth: {
    request: function (req, token) {
        token = token.split(';');

        this.options._setHeaders.call(this, req {
            header1: token[0],
            header2: token[1],
            header3: token[2],
            header4: token[3]
        });
    },
    response: function (res) {
        var headers = this.options._getHeaders.call(this, res);

        if (headers.header1 && headers.header2 && headers.header3 && headers.header4) {
            return headers.header1 + ';' + headers.header2 + ';' + headers.header3 + ';' + headers.header4;
        }
    }
}
~~~



## Privileges

The `vue-auth` plugin works with the `vue-router` plugin. Setting an `auth` field in the router mapping section will set access to that route.

**Vue 1.x**

~~~
Vue.router.map({
    '/admin': {
        auth: 'admin',
        component: require('./Admin')
    },
    '/manage': {
        auth: ['admin', 'manager'],
        component: require('./Manage')
    },
    '/account': {
        auth: true,
        component: require('./Account')
    },
    '/private': {
        auth: [{"people": "administrator", "people": "superadmin"}],
        component: require('./Account')
    },
    '/login': {
        auth: false,
        component: require('./Login')
    },
    '/contact': {
        component: require('./Contact')
    }
});
~~~

**Vue 2.x**

~~~
Vue.router = new VueRouter({
    routes: [{
        path: '/admin',
        meta: {auth: 'admin'},
        component: require('./Admin')
    }, {
        path: '/manage',
        meta: {auth: ['admin', 'manager']},
        component: require('./Manage')
    }, {
        path: '/account',
        meta: {auth: true},
        component: require('./Account')
    }, {
        path: '/private',
        meta: {auth: [{"people": "administrator", "people": "superadmin"}]},
        component: require('./Account')
    }, {
        path: '/login',
        meta: {auth: false},
        component: require('./Login')
    }, {
        path: '/contact',
        component: require('./Contact')
    }]
});
~~~


## Routes

### auth: `true`

* User must be authenticated (no roles are checked).

### auth: `false`

* If the user is logged in then this route will be unavailable. Useful for login/register type pages to be unaccessible once the user is logged in.

### auth: `undefined`

* Public, no checks required.

### auth: `Array` `String`

* The user must be logged in. Additionally the string or array will be checked against the users roles.
* Note that the users `roles` variable can be set in the options.

### auth: `Object`

* The user must be logged in and the object will be checked against the users roles.
* Note for this to work both the auth and user roles must both be objects.
* An object must also be used when using `$auth.check({some: 'name'})` where the value can be a `String` or `Array`.




## Methods

These are all methods available in the vue app via `$auth`.

* All `success` and `error` functions will receive proper context from currently called component.

### ready

* Fires once on the initial app load to pre-load users (if set).

~~~
<div v-if="$auth.ready()">
    <vue-router></vue-router>
</div>
<div v-if="!$auth.ready()">
    Site loading...
</div>
~~~

### user

* Returns the currently stored users data.

~~~
<div>
    {{ $auth.user().email }}
</div>
~~~

### check

* Check to see if the user is logged in.
* It also accepts arguments to check for a specific role or set of roles.

~~~
<a v-if="!$auth.check()" v-link="'/login'">login</a>
<a v-if="$auth.check('admin')">admin</a>
<a v-if="$auth.check(['admin', 'manager')]">manage</a>
<a v-if="$auth.check()" v-on:click="$auth.logout()">logout</a>
~~~

### other

* Checks if secondary "other" user is logged in.

~~~
<a v-if="$auth.other()" v-on:click="logoutOther()">logout other</a>
~~~

### disableOther

* Disables other using the default token until it is re-enabled (or logged out).
* This allows you to login is as "another" user but still perform requests as an admin.

~~~
this.$auth.disableOther();

this.$http.get('users'); // Will run as admin.

this.$auth.enableOther();
~~~

### enableOther

* See disableOther.

### token

* Returns the currently activated token if none are specified.
* Can also specify a specific token, but only `other` and `default` will actually return anything.

~~~
var token = this.$auth.token();
var token = this.$auth.token('other');
var token = this.$auth.token('default');
~~~

### fetch

* Fetch the user (again) allowing the users data to be reset (from the api).
* Data object is passed directly to http method.

~~~
this.$auth.fetch({
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    // etc...
});
~~~

### refresh

* Manually refresh the token.
* The refresh will always fire on boot, to disable this override the `expiredToken` option method.
* Can be used in conjunction with `expiredToken` and `token` to write custom refreshes.
* If any custom expiration custom logic needs to be done (for instance decoding and checking expiration date in jwt token) override the `expiredToken` method and return `boolean`.
* Data object is passed directly to http method.

~~~
this.$auth.refresh({
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    // etc...
});
~~~

### register

* Convenience method for registration.
* Data object is passed directly to http method.
* Accepts `autoLogin` parameter to attempt login directly after register.
* Accepts `rememberMe` parameter when used in conjunction with `autoLogin` equal to `true`.
* Accepts `redirect` parameter which is passed directly to router.

~~~
this.$auth.register({
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    autoLogin: true,
    rememberMe: true,
    redirect: {name: 'account'},
    // etc...
});
~~~

### login

* Data object is passed directly to http method.
* Accepts `rememberMe` parameter.
* Accepts `redirect` parameter which is passed directly to router.

~~~
this.$auth.login({
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    rememberMe: true,
    redirect: '/account',
    // etc...
});
~~~

### logout

* Data object is passed directly to http method.
* Accepts `redirect` parameter which is passed directly to router.
* Accepts `makeRequest` parameter which must be set to `true` to send request to api. Otherwise the logout just happens locally by deleting tokens.

~~~
this.$auth.logout({
    makeRequest: true,
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    redirect: '/login',
    // etc...
});
~~~

### loginOther

* Data object is passed directly to http method.
* Accepts `redirect` parameter which is passed directly to router.

~~~
this.$auth.loginOther({
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    redirect: {name: 'account'},
    // etc...
});
~~~

### logoutOther

* Data object is passed directly to http method.
* Accepts `redirect` parameter which is passed directly to router.
* Also accepts `makeRequest` parameter same as `logout` method.

~~~
this.$auth.logoutOther({
    makeRequest: true,
    params: {},
    success: function () {},
    error: function () {},
    redirect: {path: '/admin'},
    // etc...
});
~~~

### oauth2

* Convenience method for OAuth2.
* Initial request is to third party.
* Second call is to api server.
* Accepts `code` parameter which should be set to `true` when the code is set.
* Accepts `provider` parameter which hooks into data for third party.
* Third party data should follow format such as `facebookData`, `facebookOath2Data`. Check options section for more info.
* Accepts `redirect` parameter which is passed directly to router.

~~~
if (this.$route.query.code) {
    this.$auth.oauth2({
        code: true,
        provider: 'facebook',
        params: {
            code: this.code
        },
        success: function(res) {},
        error: function (res) {}
        redirect: {path: '/account'},
        // etc
    });
}
else {
    this.$auth.oauth2({
        provider: 'facebook'
    });
}
~~~



## Options

Pretty much all methods are overrideable now in case there any specific issues with a particular version of Vue.

## Change Log

### v1.5.x-beta

* Added auth driver for "devise".
* Updated docs to include info about parsing user data from server.

### v1.4.x-beta

* Simplified support for auth drivers.


### v1.3.x-beta

* Add support for sub route `auth` matching via parent in Vue 2.


### v1.2.x-beta

* Token parameters now accept `request` and `response` params instead of `name`.
* Support for Vue 2 `auth` in `meta` of route.


### v1.0.x-dev

* Module renamed to `vue-auth` from `vue-jwt-auth`.
* Package name is scoped through `@websanova/vue-auth` now.
* Added demo with lots of sample code.
* Added demo server (https://api-demo.websanova.com) available on GitHub (https://github.com/websanova/laravel-api-demo).
* Any default data for a request is an object now that goes directly into the `http` method. So it can be called with whatever parameters the method supports.
* All `success` and `error` functions will contain proper context from Vue component.
* Redirects can be objects now, so you can do a redirect as a `/path` or `{name: 'object'}` etc.
* There is now a new `register` call with the option to auto login on success.
* The `auth` parameter in routes and the `check()` method now support objects for checking more complicated roles.
* Better handling for invalid tokens.
* All functions are overrideable now.
* There is a driver file for vue which supports the binding between the plugin and framework. This allows multiple drivers and overrides for any issues between versions in the future and allows full backward compatability.
* Reverted from using Vue in the base code and just went back to regular JavaScript (was not really a good idea).
* Any functions, fields parameters that involve logging in a secondary user are called `other` now.
* Actions can now be performed as "admin" user when logged in as "other" user by using `disabledOther` and `enableOther`.
* The `login`, `oauth2`, etc all have their own default parameters now.
* Removed `google` and `facebook` functions just use `oauth2` method now.
* The `logout` method can now perform an api request if `makdeRequest` is set to true.
* Switch to Vanilla JavaScriipt (for development). Had some issues with using fancy es6 syntax.
* Support for drivers allowing more flexibility between different versions (this is still in development).
* Two auth drivers which are named `bearer` and `basic`.
* A fetch call has been added allowing the user to be reset.
* Now supports a "loose" driver based model for authentication allowing for some customization of request/response intercepts for requests.
* The token function will return current function or called with `other` or `default` will return the appropriate token.
* Checking token expiration (base64 decode) has been removed. Since a refresh will not occur often for SPA it was a bit too much extra code. Will need to do it custom if it's really necessary.
* Reduced file size.
* Simpler consistent code base.
* Properly packaged and minified distribution.
* General bug fixes and improvements.
